                    <p class="dropcap">
                        Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Roman Republic in the 6th century BC, though not outside the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century
                        BC. Thus, it was an "empire" (a great power) long before it had an emperor. The Republic was not a nation-state in the modern sense, but a network of
                        self-ruled towns (with varying degrees of independence from the Senate) and provinces administered by military commanders. It was governed by annually elected
                        magistrates (Roman consuls above all) in conjunction with the Senate. The 1st century BC was a time of political and military upheaval, which ultimately
                        led to rule by emperors. The consuls' military power rested in the Roman legal concept of imperium, meaning "command" (typically in a military sense).
                        Occasionally, successful consuls or generals were given the honorary title imperator (commander); this is the origin of the word emperor, since this title
                        was always bestowed to the early emperors.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Rome suffered a long series of internal conflicts, conspiracies, and civil wars from the late second century BC (see Crisis of the Roman Republic) while
                        greatly extending its power beyond Italy. In 44 BC Julius Caesar was briefly perpetual dictator before being assassinated by a faction that opposed his
                        concentration of power. This faction was driven from Rome and defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC by Mark Antony and Caesar's adopted son Octavian.
                        Antony and Octavian divided the Roman world between them, but this did not last long. Octavian's forces defeated those of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the
                        Battle of Actium in 31 BC. In 27 BC the Senate gave him the title Augustus ("venerated") and made him princeps ("foremost") with proconsular imperium, thus
                        beginning the Principate, the first epoch of Roman imperial history. Although the republic stood in name, Augustus had all meaningful authority. During his
                        40-year rule, a new constitutional order emerged so that, upon his death, Tiberius would succeed him as the new de facto monarch.

                    <p>
                        As Roman provinces were being established throughout the Mediterranean, Italy maintained a special status which made it domina provinciarum ("ruler of the
                        provinces"), and - especially in relation to the first centuries of imperial stability rectrix mundi ("governor of the world") and omnium terrarum
                        parens ("parent of all lands").
                    </p>

                <h2 id="paxromana">Pax Romana</h2>
                    <p class="dropcap">
                        The 200 years that began with Augustus's rule is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana ("Roman Peace"). The cohesion of the empire was furthered by a
                        degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced. Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent and put down
                        "mercilessly and swiftly".[38] The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented
                        potential heirs. The Julio-Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors—Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero—before it yielded in 69 AD to the
                        strife-torn Year of the Four Emperors, from which Vespasian emerged as victor. Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty, followed by the
                        Nerva–Antonine dynasty which produced the "Five Good Emperors": Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius.

                    <h2 id="classtolate">Transition from classical to late antiquity</h2>
                    <p class="dropcap">
                        In the view of contemporary Greek historian Cassius Dio, the accession of Commodus in 180 marked the descent "from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron",
                        a comment which has led some historians, notably Edward Gibbon, to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the Empire's decline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 212, during the reign of Caracalla, Roman citizenship was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. The Severan dynasty was tumultuous; an emperor's
                        reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution and, following its collapse, the Empire was engulfed by the Crisis of the Third Century, a period of
                        invasions, civil strife, economic disorder, and plague. In defining historical epochs, this crisis sometimes marks the transition from Classical to Late Antiquity.
                        Aurelian (r. 270–275) stabilised the empire militarily and Diocletian reorganised and restored much of it in 285.[44] Diocletian's reign brought the empire's most
                        concerted effort against the perceived threat of Christianity, the "Great Persecution".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Diocletian divided the empire into four regions, each ruled by a separate tetrarch. Confident that he fixed the disorder plaguing Rome, he abdicated along with
                        his co-emperor, but the Tetrarchy collapsed shortly after. Order was eventually restored by Constantine the Great, who became the first emperor to convert to
                        Christianity, and who established Constantinople as the new capital of the Eastern Empire. During the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties,
                        the empire was divided along an east–west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome. Julian, who under the influence of his adviser Mardonius
                        attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Theodosius I, the last emperor to
                        rule over both East and West, died in 395 after making Christianity the state religion.

                    <p class="dropcap">
                        The Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate in the early 5th century. The Romans fought off all invaders, most famously Attila, but the empire had
                        assimilated so many Germanic peoples of dubious loyalty to Rome that the empire started to dismember itself. Most chronologies place the end of the Western
                        Roman Empire in 476, when Romulus Augustulus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Odoacer ended the Western Empire by declaring Zeno sole emperor and placing himself as Zeno's nominal subordinate. In reality, Italy was ruled by Odoacer alone.
                        The Eastern Roman Empire, called the Byzantine Empire by later historians, continued until the reign of Constantine XI Palaiologos, the last Roman emperor. He
                        died in battle in 1453 against Mehmed II and his Ottoman forces during the siege of Constantinople. Mehmed II adopted the title of caesar in an attempt to claim
                        a connection to the former Empire. His claim was soon recognized by the Patriarchate of Constantinople, but not by most European monarchs.

                                    Nerva (/ˈnɜːrvə/; born Marcus Cocceius Nerva; 8 November 30 – 27 January 98) was a Roman emperor from 96 to 98. Nerva became emperor when aged almost 66,
                                    after a lifetime of imperial service under Nero and the succeeding rulers of the Flavian dynasty. Under Nero, he was a member of the imperial entourage
                                    and played a vital part in exposing the Pisonian conspiracy of 65. Later, as a loyalist to the Flavians, he attained consulships in 71 and 90 during the
                                    reigns of Vespasian and Domitian, respectively. On 18 September 96, Domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy involving members of the Praetorian
                                    Guard and several of his freedmen. On the same day, Nerva was declared emperor by the Roman Senate. As the new ruler of the Roman Empire, he vowed to
                                    restore liberties which had been curtailed during the autocratic government of Domitian.

                                    Trajan (/ˈtreɪdʒən/ TRAY-jən; born Marcus Ulpius Traianus, adopted name Caesar Nerva Traianus; 18 September 53 – c. 11 August 117) was a Roman
                                    emperor from AD 98 to 117, remembered as the second of the Five Good Emperors of the Nerva–Antonine dynasty. He was a philanthropic ruler and a
                                    successful soldier-emperor who presided over one of the greatest military expansions in Roman history, during which, by the time of his death, the
                                    Roman Empire reached its maximum territorial extent. He was given the title of Optimus ('the best') by the Roman Senate. As emperor of Rome, Trajan
                                    oversaw the construction of building projects such as the forum named after him, the introduction of social welfare policies such as the alimenta,
                                    and new military conquests. He annexed Nabataea and Dacia, and his war against the Parthian Empire ended with the incorporation of Armenia,
                                    Mesopotamia, and Assyria as Roman provinces.

                                    Hadrian (/ˈheɪdriən/ HAY-dree-ən; Latin: Publius Aelius Hadrianus [(h)adriˈjaːnus]; 24 January 76 – 10 July 138) was Roman emperor from 117 to 138.
                                    Hadrian was born in Italica, close to modern Seville in Spain, an Italic settlement in Hispania Baetica; his branch of the Aelia gens, the Aeli
                                    Hadriani, came from the town of Hadria in eastern Italy. He was a member of the Nerva-Antonine dynasty. Hadrian energetically pursued his own
                                    Imperial ideals and personal interests. He visited almost every province of the Empire, and indulged a preference for direct intervention in
                                    imperial and provincial affairs, especially building projects. He is particularly known for building Hadrian's Wall, which marked the northern limit
                                    of Britannia.  In Rome itself, he rebuilt the Pantheon and constructed the vast Temple of Venus and Roma. In Egypt, he may have rebuilt the Serapeum of
                                    Alexandria. Late in Hadrian's reign, he suppressed the Bar Kokhba revolt; he saw this rebellion as a failure of his panhellenic ideal.

                                    Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Pius (19 September AD 86 – 7 March 161) was Roman emperor from AD 138 to 161. He was the fourth of the Five Good
                                    Emperors from the Nerva–Antonine dynasty. His reign is notable for the peaceful state of the Empire, with no major revolts or military incursions
                                    during this time. A successful military campaign in southern Scotland early in his reign resulted in the construction of the Antonine Wall. Antoninus
                                    was an effective administrator, leaving his successors a large surplus in the treasury, expanding free access to drinking water throughout the Empire,
                                    encouraging legal conformity, and facilitating the enfranchisement of freed slaves. He died of illness in AD 161 and was succeeded by his adopted sons
                                    Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus as co-emperors.

                                    Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (Latin: [ˈmaːrkʊs au̯ˈreːliʊs antoːˈniːnʊs]; English: /ɔːˈriːliəs/ or-EE-lee-əs; 26 April 121 – 17 March 180) was Roman
                                    emperor from 161 to 180 and a Stoic philosopher. He was a member of the Nerva–Antonine dynasty, the last of the rulers later known as the Five Good
                                    Emperors and the last emperor of the Pax Romana, an age of relative peace, calm, and stability for the Roman Empire lasting from 27 BC to 180 AD. He
                                    served as Roman consul in 140, 145, and 161. After Antoninus died in 161, Marcus acceded to the throne alongside his adoptive brother, who took the
                                    regnal name Lucius Aurelius Verus. Under the reign of Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Empire witnessed much military conflict. In the East, the Romans fought
                                    the Parthian war of Lucius Verus with a revitalized Parthian Empire and the rebel Kingdom of Armenia. Marcus defeated the Marcomanni, Quadi, and Sarmatian
                                    Iazyges in the Marcomannic Wars. These and other Germanic peoples began to represent a troubling reality for the Empire. He reduced the silver purity of
                                    the Roman currency, the denarius.
