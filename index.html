                    <p class="dropcap">
                        Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Roman Republic in the 6th century BC, though not outside the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century
                        BC. Thus, it was an "empire" (a great power) long before it had an emperor. The Republic was not a nation-state in the modern sense, but a network of
                        self-ruled towns (with varying degrees of independence from the Senate) and provinces administered by military commanders. It was governed by annually elected
                        magistrates (Roman consuls above all) in conjunction with the Senate. The 1st century BC was a time of political and military upheaval, which ultimately
                        led to rule by emperors. The consuls' military power rested in the Roman legal concept of imperium, meaning "command" (typically in a military sense).
                        Occasionally, successful consuls or generals were given the honorary title imperator (commander); this is the origin of the word emperor, since this title
                        was always bestowed to the early emperors.

                    <p>
                        Rome suffered a long series of internal conflicts, conspiracies, and civil wars from the late second century BC (see Crisis of the Roman Republic) while
                        greatly extending its power beyond Italy. In 44 BC Julius Caesar was briefly perpetual dictator before being assassinated by a faction that opposed his
                        concentration of power. This faction was driven from Rome and defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC by Mark Antony and Caesar's adopted son Octavian.
                        Antony and Octavian divided the Roman world between them, but this did not last long. Octavian's forces defeated those of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the
                        Battle of Actium in 31 BC. In 27 BC the Senate gave him the title Augustus ("venerated") and made him princeps ("foremost") with proconsular imperium, thus
                        beginning the Principate, the first epoch of Roman imperial history. Although the republic stood in name, Augustus had all meaningful authority. During his
                        40-year rule, a new constitutional order emerged so that, upon his death, Tiberius would succeed him as the new de facto monarch.

                    <p>
                        As Roman provinces were being established throughout the Mediterranean, Italy maintained a special status which made it domina provinciarum ("ruler of the
                        provinces"), and - especially in relation to the first centuries of imperial stability rectrix mundi ("governor of the world") and omnium terrarum
                        parens ("parent of all lands").
                    </p>

                <h2 id="paxromana">Pax Romana</h2>
                    <p class="dropcap">
                        The 200 years that began with Augustus's rule is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana ("Roman Peace"). The cohesion of the empire was furthered by a
                        degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced. Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent and put down
                        "mercilessly and swiftly".[38] The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented
                        potential heirs. The Julio-Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors—Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero—before it yielded in 69 AD to the
                        strife-torn Year of the Four Emperors, from which Vespasian emerged as victor. Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty, followed by the
                        Nerva–Antonine dynasty which produced the "Five Good Emperors": Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius.

                    <p>
                        In the view of contemporary Greek historian Cassius Dio, the accession of Commodus in 180 marked the descent "from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron",
                        a comment which has led some historians, notably Edward Gibbon, to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the Empire's decline.

                    <p>
                        In 212, during the reign of Caracalla, Roman citizenship was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. The Severan dynasty was tumultuous; an emperor's
                        reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution and, following its collapse, the Empire was engulfed by the Crisis of the Third Century, a period of
                        invasions, civil strife, economic disorder, and plague. In defining historical epochs, this crisis sometimes marks the transition from Classical to Late Antiquity.
                        Aurelian (r. 270–275) stabilised the empire militarily and Diocletian reorganised and restored much of it in 285.[44] Diocletian's reign brought the empire's most
                        concerted effort against the perceived threat of Christianity, the "Great Persecution".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Diocletian divided the empire into four regions, each ruled by a separate tetrarch. Confident that he fixed the disorder plaguing Rome, he abdicated along with
                        his co-emperor, but the Tetrarchy collapsed shortly after. Order was eventually restored by Constantine the Great, who became the first emperor to convert to
                        Christianity, and who established Constantinople as the new capital of the Eastern Empire. During the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties,
                        the empire was divided along an east–west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome. Julian, who under the influence of his adviser Mardonius
                        attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Theodosius I, the last emperor to
                        rule over both East and West, died in 395 after making Christianity the state religion.
